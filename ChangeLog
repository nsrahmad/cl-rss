	* Version 0.9.0
	* Commit patch from Rupert Swarbrick: Parse RSS version 2 and
	export slot readers.  This change allows CL-RSS to parse RSS
	version 2 feeds as well as 0.9x feeds. Channels gain four slots:
	language, image, pub-date and last-build-date. Items gain a
	description and pub-date.  The readers for these slot values are
	now exported from the package.
